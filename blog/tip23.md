### Traffic Percentage for Web Apps with Azure App Service

#### Intro

We've recently created a [web app](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip19.html) and uploaded it to Azure App Service. We also took a look at [multiple ways](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip20.html) to examine those files through the Azure portal interface and how we'd add [extensions](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip21.html) and [deployment slots](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip22.html) for our web app. In this post, we'll look at a feature called `Routing Rules`.  

#### Traffic Percentage Feature of Azure App Service

Go to the Azure Portal and select any App Service that uses at least 2 deployment slots. Click on **Deployment Slots** under **Deployment**. Take a look at one of the slots and you'll see traffic percentage. 

**What is Traffic Percentage** This section lets you control how traffic is distributed between your production and other slots. This is useful if you want to try out a new change with a small percentage of requests and then gradually increase the percentage of requests that get the new behavior.

A scenario could be - We'll want to split the traffic to our site into 2 groups to test our new site and see if customers like it. 

Production - 75%
Staging - 25%

Now keep in mind that we have two versions of our site. One that is `production` and `staging`. They are identical except for the staging site has a large font that says `jsQuizEngine version 2`. 

We don't want to **swap** sites, we just want to **distribute** traffic between the two sites. 

I can test this by going to my production url and refreshing the site until the `staging` site is shown with the production url.

Success! it works, but what happens when they leave the site? We actually store a cookie that keeps track of it. You can find this cookie yourself by expecting the site and looking for the cookie shown below.
