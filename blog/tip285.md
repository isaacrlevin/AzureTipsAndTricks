### A Lap around the new Azure VM Extension for VS Code

#### Managing Virtual Machines from VS Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) is a great tool for almost every programming task. It can do almost anything, because you can install extensions for almost any scenario. This is also true for managing [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev).

In this post, we'll take a look at the [Azure Virtual Machines extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurevirtualmachines&WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev).

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* The latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### Azure Virtual Machines extension for VS Code
Let's see what the Azure Virtual Machines extension for VS Code can do for us:

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to the **Extensions** menu
3. Search for **"Azure Virtual Machines"** and select the result

4. Select **install** to install the extension
5. Once installed, you can access the extension by clicking on the **Azure icon** in the menu on the left
6. You might have to click **Login to Azure** to login to your Azure account

The extension will load your existing Azure VMs. If you right-click on a VM, you'll see the actions that you can perform. You can **start** and **stop** the VM. You can **delete** it and open it in the **Azure portal**. You can also provide an existing SSH key to the VM that you can use to login to it using SSH.

You can also create a new VM with the extension. Let's try that.

1. In VS Code, in the Azure Virtual Machine extension menu, click the **"plus"** button on the top to create a new Virtual Machine. This creates a Linux Virtual Machine with standard settings, like with an inbound port 22 open for SSH access
2. Enter a **name** for the VM
3. Fill in a **passphrase** and repeat it. This is used for the SSH key that will be created on your local machine and that you can use to SSH into the VM
4. Select a **location** for the VM

That's it. The VM will be created and shows up in the list of VMs. When the new VM is created, we can connect to it with the [Remote - SSH VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh&WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). Let's try it:

1. In VS Code, go to the **Extensions** menu
2. Search for **"SSH Remote"** and select the result

<img :src="$withBase('/files/71ssh.png')">

(The SSH - Remote VS Code extension)

3. Click **install** to install the extension
4. Select the **Remote explorer** menu in VS Code and select **SSH targets** from the dropdown menu in the top
5. You should see your new VM in the list. Right-click it and select **Connect to host in current window**
6. Enter the **passphrase** that you entered when you created the VM

You should now be connected to the VM and you can see that you are connected in the bottom-left corner of VS Code. Click on the green connection in the bottom-left corner and select **Remote-SSH: Show Log** to show the VMs logs. You can also switch to the **terminal** tab from there and see that you are connected to the VM. From there, you can type commands, like **"ls -la"** to see files on the VM.

#### Conclusion
You can now work with your [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) with the [Azure Virtual Machines extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurevirtualmachines?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev).
