### Easily Send JSON to IoT Hub with C#

I recently needed to send JSON that an IoT Hub could receive and display on an AZ3166 device. Once the AZ3166 device receives the message, then it could do a number of things with the data such as open an door. 

Part 1: 

* Create an IoT Hub and provision the MX Chip (AZ3166) as a device. While we could go into the Azure Portal and create a new IoT Hub and walk through the setup of our device, etc. There is an easier way. 
* [Download the tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-arduino-iot-devkit-az3166-get-started#prepare-the-development-environment?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
* Open **VS Code**, look under **Arduino Examples** and open the **GetStarted** sample and run `task cloud-provision` in the VS Code terminal..

* If you switch over to the Azure Portal, and look under your new IoT, then Devices - you should see your new device.

Part 2:

* I took the code from the “GetStarted” sample found in VS Code and tweaked the `Screen.print(0, "Unlock Door");` lines in the `GetStarted.ino` file in the `Setup` method. 
* Now on my deivce it prints the “Unlock Door” message in fancy yellow and displays the IP Address and waits for a message to be sent to IoT Hub.

Part 3:

* Open Visual Studio and create a console application. 
* Add NuGet package : Microsoft.Azure.Devices (Service SDK for Azure IoT Hub)
* I hardcoded my connection string (found in IoT Hub) and mocked the JSON data. 

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Azure.Devices;

namespace SendMessageToIoTHub
{
    class Program
    {
        static ServiceClient serviceClient;
        static string connectionString = "mykey";

        static void Main(string[] args)

        {
            serviceClient = ServiceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);
            SendCloudToDeviceMessageAsync().Wait();
            Console.ReadLine();
        }

        private async static Task SendCloudToDeviceMessageAsync()
        {
            string mockedJsonData =

                "{ \"Locked\":true}";

            var commandMessage = new Message(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(mockedJsonData));
            await serviceClient.SendAsync("AZ3166", commandMessage);
        }
    }
}
```

Part 4:

* The MX Board receives the message from IoT Hub
* It prints the JSON message from the serviceClient code above to the board display.
