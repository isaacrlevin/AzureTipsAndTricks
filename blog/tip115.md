### Remove Azure Secrets committed to GitHub

#### Remove passwords committed to GitHub on accident

Writing code day after day means secrets, connection strings and more get added to your code accidentally. And if you are like me, they get committed to your GitHub repo and then you have to live in shame. :) In this post, I'll walk you through removing secrets from a GitHub repo that you've already committed the secret to. 

Part 1 - Initial setup: 

Scenario: You have committed a password with the value of `qph@}uC,7cGLBdsX` to your GitHub repo. This password should be confidential and not stored in the code. 

How do you fix it?

* Ensure you have the repo on your local disk or clone a fresh copy with HTTPS or SSH. I'll use SSH `git clone git@github.com:mbcrump/crumpbot.git` as a sample.
* Clone a copy of your repo that has the secret stored using the mirror option, like the following `git clone --mirror git@github.com:mbcrump/crumpbot.git`. 
* You'll now have a BARE repo. CD into it with `cd crumpbot.git` and run `ls -l` to list out the contents on macOS or `dir` on Windows. 

Below is an example of my repo.

```
[mbcrump@Michaels-MBP-3]:[~/Documents/code]$ cd crumpbot.git
[mbcrump@Michaels-MBP-3]:[~/Documents/code/crumpbot.git] (BARE:master)$ ls -l
total 32
-rw-r--r--   1 mbcrump  staff   23 Dec  1 19:47 HEAD
-rw-r--r--   1 mbcrump  staff  211 Dec  1 19:47 config
-rw-r--r--   1 mbcrump  staff   73 Dec  1 19:47 description
drwxr-xr-x  13 mbcrump  staff  416 Dec  1 19:47 hooks
drwxr-xr-x   3 mbcrump  staff   96 Dec  1 19:47 info
drwxr-xr-x  27 mbcrump  staff  864 Dec  1 19:48 objects
-rw-r--r--   1 mbcrump  staff  105 Dec  1 19:47 packed-refs
drwxr-xr-x   4 mbcrump  staff  128 Dec  1 19:47 refs
```

Part 2 - Create a file of passwords that you'd like to remove:

* Create a `passwords.txt` file and place and enter the passwords that you'd like to remove from your GitHub repo. 

I created mine on macOS with `touch passwords.txt` or `echo some-text  > passwords.txt` on Windows and added the password that I accidentally committed:

```
qph@}uC,7cGLBdsX
```
* Save the file.

Part 3 - Install BFG:

Enter [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/). According to the author:

>BFG is a simpler, faster alternative to git-filter-branch for cleansing bad data out of your Git repository history:
>Removing Crazy Big Files
>Removing Passwords, Credentials & other Private data


* Install [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) with `brew install bfg` assuming you have Homebrew installed and using a Mac or [download](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) the JAR file if you are on Windows.

Part 4 - Clean up the passwords previously committed:

* Run `bfg --replace-text passwords.txt crumpbot.git` on Mac or `java -jar bfg.jar --replace-text passwords.txt crumpbot.git` if using the JAR file.

* Below is output from that command:

```bash
[mbcrump@Michaels-MBP-3]:[~/Documents/code]$ bfg --replace-text passwords.txt crumpbot.git

Using repo : /Users/mbcrump/Documents/code/crumpbot.git

These are your protected commits, and so their contents will NOT be altered:

BFG run is complete! When ready, run: git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

Part 5 - Pushing to GitHub:

* Run `git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive` as indicated by the output.
* Run `git push` to push it to your repo.

Part 6 - Wrap-up and verify your repo was updated successfully:

If you go back to your GitHub repo and look at prior commits, then you should see ****REMOVED**** like the following:

```javascript
var tmi = require("tmi.js")
var channel = "mbcrump"

var config = {
    options: {
        debug: true
    }, 
    connection: {
        cluster: "aws", 
        reconnect: true
    },
    identity: {
        username: "mbcrump",
        password: "***REMOVED***"
    },
    channels: [channel]
}
```
