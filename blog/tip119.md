### Determine the outbound IP addresses of your Azure App Service

Because some networks are locked down and only allow whitelisted IP addresses, I hear these questions a lot. 

* What is my Azure Web Apps outbound IP address?
* What IP addresses do I need to whitelist?

##### Question 1

For an individual Azure Web App, you can simply go to the **Properties** of the application:

You can click the copy button to add them to your clipboard. 

##### Question 2

If you need to whitelist a region, I first lookup to see what region it is currently deployed in. You can find this information from the **Overview** page of the application.

Microsoft provide a list of the [Azure Data Center IP ranges in XML format](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)

So download this file and search for your region and now you know what IP address to whitelist.
