### Azure REST APIs with Postman
 
Postman is a powerful tool for performing integration testing with your APIs. It allows us to perform repeatable, reliable tests that can be automated and used in a variety of environments and includes useful tools for persisting data and simulating how a user might actually be interacting with the system. In this article we will demonstrate how to use Postman to test/validate the REST APIs.


1. Download and install the [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) native app for your operating system

2. Launch the postman app and create a new environment for this project. I named it as "azuretips". To learn more about creating an environment refer to this [link](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments/)

3. Create a service principal from your Azure Cloud Shell.  This way you don't have to install Azure CLI in your local desktop.

```
az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "your service principal name"

e.g. az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "azuretips"
Creating a role assignment under the scope of "/subscriptions/11389280-b2a2-***********"
  Retrying role assignment creation: 1/36
  Retrying role assignment creation: 2/36
  Retrying role assignment creation: 3/36
{
  "appId": "d2846107-f7ae-439b-8a16-da440d52e950",
  "displayName": "azuretips",
  "name": "http://azuretips",
  "password": "00593485-8bda-4c2b-8c4e-2ab52241c24c",
  "tenant": "72f98xxx-86f1-41af-****"
}

```

4. To get your azure subscription id execute the following command in your cloud shell

```
az account show --query id
"11389280-b2a2-4183-b757-xxxxxx"

```

5. Input the tenantid (tenant), clientid (appId), clientsecret (password), subid (subscription ID) in postman's "azuretips" environment section that was created in Step # 2. See the screenshot below

6. Create a new collection in your postman app to store all your REST calls in an isolated section. To learn more about collections in postman, refer to this [link](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/creating_the_first_collection/)

7. We need to get the bearer token before executing any Azure REST API calls. 

8. Issue a POST request to 

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/:tenantid/oauth2/token 

``` 

with the following details

```
	- Params Tab >> Path Variables.

	Key: tenantid
	Value: {{tenantid}}
	
	- Authroization Tab

	Type: Inherit auth from parent
	
	- Headers Tab

	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	
	-  Body tab

	grant_type: client_credentials
	client_id: {{clientid}}
	client_secret: {{clientsecret}}
	resource: https://management.azure.com/
	
	- following value in the Tests tab
	pm.environment.set("bearerToken", pm.response.json().access_token);
	
```

<img :src="$withBase('/files/azurepostman-file3.jpg')">

You might be thinking this is a lot of work. But this is just a one time setup in Postman and you can share,re-use or duplicate this environment with your co-workers.


After getting the bearer token you can execute the Azure REST APIs for getting Resource Groups, details about a particular Resource Group, VNets etc..

As an example I issued a GET request to get details about a resource group in my azure subscription. In the Header section add a key "Authorization" with value Bearer {{bearerToken}}

See the screenshot below

#### Conclusion

Postman is a comprehensive API testing tool that makes it easy to set up automated tests. You can aggregate the tests and requests youâ€™ve created into a single automated test sequence. It is the only complete API development and testing environment and provides a single source of truth to your organization. In this article we learned how to use Postman with Azure REST APIs.
