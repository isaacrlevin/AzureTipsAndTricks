### Explicitly Name Logic API Connections in ARM Templates

When creating Logic App API Connections, Azure defaults to rather bland, non-descriptive names such as `office365` or `keyvault`. After creating a few of them, positively identifying them gets confusing. (Separate connections should be created as each Logic App should have a unique, system-assigned identity.)

#### 1. Edit the Connection Specification

In the example below, the `name` and `displayName` segments are changed to calculated values using `[variables('vEmailSender')]`.

``` JSON
{
    "type": "Microsoft.Web/connections",
    "apiVersion": "2016-06-01",
    "name": "[variables('vEmailSender')]",
    "location": "[parameters('pLocation')]",
    "properties": {
        "api": {
            "id": "[concat(subscription().id, '/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/', parameters('pLocation'), '/managedApis/office365')]"
        },
        "displayName": "[variables('vEmailSender')]"
    }
}
```

(Parameters are equally valid here.)

It can cause confusion that both the `name` and `displayName` segments also default to `office365`. Do not change the `api/id` segment!

#### 2. Modify the `dependsOn` segment of the Logic App

``` JSON
{
    ...
    "dependsOn": [
        "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/connections', variables('vEmailSender'))]"
    ]
    ...
}
```

#### 3. Modify the `$connections` used by the Logic App

The connection definition used in the Logic App must match the resource definition in (1).

``` JSON
{
    "$connections": {
        "value": {
            "office365": {
                "connectionId": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/connections', variables('vEmailSender'))]",
                "connectionName": "[variables('vEmailSender')]",
                "id": "[concat(subscription().id, '/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/',parameters('pLocation'),'/managedApis/office365')]"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Notice how `connectionId` is a concatenation of the resource type and name, and the `id` is the same as the `api/id`.

#### Conclusion

It wasn't entirely clear what specifically needed changing in what locations to modify the defaults. Hopefully, this tip will save you the hit-n-miss process I went through.
