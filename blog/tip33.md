### Prevent Changes to Resources in Azure App Service

**Locks** allow you to prevent changes to a subscription or resources to prevent other users from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources.


In order to take advantage of locks, you'll need to log into your Azure account and go to your App Service that you created and look under **Settings** then you will see **Locks**. Open it and you'll see that you don't have any locks created. Go ahead and click **Add** and you'll see the following.

You'll want to provide the following information, but only the **Lock type** is required: 

* Name - Give it any name that you want
* Lock Type - This can be **Read-only** or **Delete**

Delete - means that you can't delete the resource, your users can still read and modify though.
ReadOnly - means users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource.

* Notes - A description of the Lock.

Fill out the form and press **OK** as shown below.

You can delete the lock by clicking on the ellipsis.
