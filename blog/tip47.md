### Creating a Container Image with Docker

#### Containers for the rest of us

For some reason, I find containers are confusing and my goal with my [Azure Tips and Tricks](https://michaelcrump.net/azure-tips-and-tricks-complete-list/) is to try to make things easier. In this mini-series, I'll walk you through [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and how I use it with Azure. Below is a list of post that you can expect for this week.

#### Create an app to run inside a Container Image with Docker

Let's continue where we [left off](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip46.html) in our last post, which showed how to use an image from the Docker Store as our base and create our own console app. In this post, we'll create a new image that we can distribute that contains our new app. 

Remember how we used the `dotnet build` command in the last post? Well if you navigate the file structure of our existing console app, then you'll see there is a `myapp.dll` that contains the executable code. 

```
root@40bac5113803:~/myapp/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0# dir
myapp.deps.json  myapp.dll  myapp.pdb  myapp.runtimeconfig.dev.json  myapp.runtimeconfig.json
```

If you navigate back to the `root` directory, then you can run `dotnet run -p /myapp/myapp.csproj` to see the `Hello World!` output. 

Let's save this into a file that we can run later. 

Type cd `cd /usr/local/bin` and then `cat > startmyapp.sh`. Add `#!/bin/bash` to the first line and then `dotnet run -p /myapp/myapp.csproj` to the second line. Press CTRL-D to exit out. 

Try out the command by typing `sh startmyapp.sh` and your app should run.

Type `exit` and you'll return to Terminal or command prompt window. 

Now we want to add our application to a container. 

Run `docker ps -a` to see what the name of our container is. 

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
7c5da93bf968        c0                  "bash"              10 minutes ago      Exited (0) 51 seconds ago                       myapp
```

Now run `docker commit 7c mbcrump:awesomeapp` to add the app to a container. After docker commit, we took the first two characters of the `container id` and created the name `mbcrump` and gave it a tag of `awesomeapp`. 

Now we can run `docker images` to see our new image! 

```
Michaels-MacBook-Pro:~ mbcrump$ docker images
REPOSITORY                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
mbcrump                      mynewapp            82eb1e5914dc        About a minute ago   1.85GB
mbcrump                      awesomeapp          1f254a9917aa        16 minutes ago       1.85GB
microsoft/aspnetcore-build   latest              c0c285a7a306        44 hours ago         1.85GB
```

Now run `docker run 82 startmyapp.sh` where `82` is the image id and `startmyapp.sh` is the shell script that we created earlier.
