### Deploy a .NET Core WebAPI Project to Web App for Containers

#### Use .NET Core WebAPI and Docker Compose

How hard do you think it is to:

* [Create and Publish a .NET Core WebAPI project](tip54.html)
* [Add it to a Docker Container using Docker Compose and push it to a Docker Hub](tip55.html)
* [Use it in Azure with Web App for Containers](tip56.html)

In this mini-series, we'll build on each part starting with creating and publishing a .NET Core WebAPI project. Yesterday, we used Docker Compose to create an image and push it to Docker Cloud and we'll wrap up today by deploying it to Azure using [Web App for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). 

#### Deploy a .NET Core WebAPI Project to Web App for Containers

In [Tip 55](tip55.html) we pushed our Docker Image to Docker Cloud. As a reminder, we created a repository in Docker Cloud and headed back to our command prompt (or terminal) and ran the following commands: 

`docker login` to authenticate 

`docker push mbcrump/mbcwebapi:latest` to push your image to Docker Cloud. 

Now that we have a Docker Cloud repository, we can push it to Azure using [Web App for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). 

Go ahead and log into the Azure Portal and search for `Web App for Containers`. You should see the following:

Press the `Create` button and you should see the following: 

<img :src="$withBase('/files/webappcont2.png')">

You should be familiar with (name, resource group, etc.) with the exception being the `Configure Container` section. 

Here we will use Docker Hub (think Docker Cloud), our repo is public, and the name of the image. Which follows the format `docker username/our app name:tag`. For a refresher, visit [Step 2 in yesterday's post](tip55/). 

After our Web App for Container is deployed, you can simply go to your new url and append `/api/values` to see your new site.
