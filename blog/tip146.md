### Rename an Azure SQL database

Last week, I did a SQL post on [Easily reset the Administrator password for an Azure SQL database](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip145.html) and it did rather well. So I'm back with another SQL post that addresses another common scenario that folks ask "How do I rename an Azure SQL database"?

#### Rename with command-line - TSQL 

1. Connect with **SQL Server Management Studio** to your Azure database server

2. Right-click on the master database and select **New Query**

3. In the **New Query window** type `ALTER DATABASE [dbname] MODIFY NAME = [newdbname]`. (Make sure you include the square brackets around both database names.)

#### Rename with a GUI - SQL Server Management Studio

1. Connect with SQL Server Management Studio 

2. Make sure **Object Explorer** pane is open. 

3. Click on the database name *(as the rename option from the dropdown will be greyed out)* and type in the new name. 

4. The Azure Portal should show the reflected the change almost immediately.
