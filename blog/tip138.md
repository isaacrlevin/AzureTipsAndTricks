### Host a Static Website with Azure Storage

A feature that was recently announced was the ability to run a static website using Azure Storage. I decided to take it for a quick test spin and show you the experience. 

Begin by creating a new **Azure Storage Account** and provide a name and under the **Account Kind** make sure that you select **StorageV2**. Go ahead and configure the rest of the options and press Create.

After it creates the resouce then go to **Settings** and select **Static website**. You'll see a couple of options after selecting **Enabled** for Static Website. 

Under the **Index Document Name** type `index.html` and under **Error document path** type `404.html`.

Once you press **Save**, you'll see there is a `$web` folder that you can click on to upload your files. I simply dropped a single `index.html` file with some text to test. You'll also want to jot down the **Primary endpoint** location as you'll test your site with that URL.

Once you've uploaded your file to `$web` then go to your browser and paste in the URL provided in the previous step.
