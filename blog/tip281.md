### Working remote for developers and teams

#### Working remotely is the new normal
In the modern workspace, working remotely is normal. Some companies are remote-only and others allow  developers to work remote part of the time. But working remotely can be challenging. You need to use tools to communicate, like [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). And you also need tools to store and share code, and collaborate on it.

In this post, we'll explore the collaboration tools for developers and development teams that help them to work remotely.

#### Work remote with Azure Repos, Visual Studio Codespaces and Visual Studio Live Share
Developers and development teams that work together need a couple of things:
1. A place to store and share code
2. An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to program with
3. A way to work on code with other developers

When developers work remotely, they can use best-of-breed tools to work together.

**1. Use Azure Repos to store and share code**
You can store and share your code with a source control system. [GitHub](https://github.com/?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) provides such a system and so does [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), in the form of [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/repos/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). Azure Repos is a modern Git repository that you can use to store your code in and share it with your team. You can connect to it with any Git client and it supports code search, pull requests and more. You can create unlimited private Git repositories with Azure Repos and you can create public repositories as well.

**2. Visual Studio Codespaces provides a remote IDE**
When your code is in a source control system, like Azure Repos, you can work on it anywhere, from any client. That is precisely what [Visual Studio Codespaces provides](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). A remote Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that you can use from anywhere. You can spin up a Visual Studio Codespaces environment in minutes and use it to develop your app in the browser, from [VS Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/online/quickstarts/vscode?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev ), from [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/online/quickstarts/vs?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev ) and even from [GitHub](https://github.com/features/codespaces/?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). Getting started is easy:

1. Go to [https://online.visualstudio.com/login](https://online.visualstudio.com/login?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) and login
2. Select **Create Codespace**
3. Create a billing plan by selecting your **Azure Subscription** and your **region** and select **Create**

4. Create a Codespace environment by filling in a **name** and optionally the **address to your Git repo** in Azure Repos and select **Create**

That's it. Now you can work on your code just like in VS Code. Visual Studio Codespaces looks and feels exactly like VS Code and it has the same capabilities. By default, it has [IntelliCode](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) and [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) enabled and you can install any VS Code extension that you want.

**3. Use Visual Studio Live Share to collaborate on code**
Working with other developers on the same code can be difficult when you are working remote. Traditionally, developers would download the same version of code from a code repository and work on it separately, on their own machines and collaborate through an audio- or video call. Now, you can use [Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), which enables you to collaborate on code in real-time. You can simply start a Live Share session and invite others to join it and work with you. Visual Studio Live Share is a native part of Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, and you can use it from Visual Studio Codespaces. 

People that you invite to work with you in a Live Share session don't even need to have the code on their local machine. It just shows up in their IDE through Live Share magic. And you can even debug code together and step through the code.

#### Conclusion
There are lots of great tools that can help you and your team to work remotely. You can use [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) for video calls and interactive meetings. There is [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/repos/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) and [GitHub](https://github.com/?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) for storing and sharing source code. You can work on your code from anywhere using [Visual Studio Codespaces](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) and you can collaborate on your code, in real-time, with [Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev).
