### Adding an item to a Azure Storage Table

In case you are new to the Azure Storage Tables, we've reviewed the following items this week:

* [Creating your first Azure Storage Table](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip82.html)
* [Today - Adding an item to a Azure Storage Table](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip83.html)
* [Reading an item from a Azure Storage Table](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip84.html)
* [Updating an item from a Azure Storage Table](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip85.html)

Today, we'll be taking a look at adding an item to the Azure Storage Table that we were working with yesterday. 

As a refresher, Azure Storage Blobs can store any type of text or binary data, such as a document, media file, or application installer. Blob storage is also referred to as object storage.


#### Getting Started

Open the C# Console application that we were working with [previously](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip82.html) and let's add a folder called **Entities** and add a class named **Thanks**.

Copy the following code into your new class:

```csharp
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table;
using System;

namespace StorageAccountAzure.Entities
{
    class Thanks : TableEntity
    {

        public string Name { get; set; }
        public DateTime Date { get; set; }

        public Thanks(string name, DateTime date)
        {
            Name = name;
            Date = date;
            PartitionKey = "ThanksApp";
            RowKey = name;
        }

        public Thanks()
        {

        }
    }
}
```

This code will use a base class of **TableEntity** which will make it easier to work with Azure Storage Tables. We are going to create two fields in our table named **Name** and **Date**. We'll pass in the Name we want to use via a string and provide the current Date for the Date property. 

Heading back over to our `Program.cs` file. We'll now add in a helper method to create the item in the table. 

```csharp
static void CreateMessage(CloudTable table, Thanks message)
{
    TableOperation insert = TableOperation.Insert(message);

    table.Execute(insert);
}
```

This will take advantage of our **Thanks** class and we'll pass in the message along with the date in the **Main** method. 

The **Main** method inside of the `Program.cs` file just needs to call the method as shown below:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
                    CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnection"));

    CloudTableClient tableClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudTableClient();

    CloudTable table = tableClient.GetTableReference("thankfulfor");

    table.CreateIfNotExists();

//added this line
    CreateMessage(table, new Thanks("I'm thankful for the time with my family", DateTime.Now));
//added this line
    Console.ReadKey();

}
```

If we run the program now, then it will add our message along with the current DateTime to our Azure Storage Table called **thankfulfor**. If we want to test it now, then we can use [Azure Storage Explorer](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip77.html). If you come back tomorrow, then I'll show you how to do this through code.
