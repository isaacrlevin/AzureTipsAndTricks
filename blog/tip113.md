### Prevent secrets from getting out with .NET Core

I was recently building out a .NET Core Console App and it had secrets such as my **Bit.ly API key** and **Azure Storage Table DB Connection string** (which also has my password). I got busy and forgot what I was doing and **committed it to GitHub**. That really sucks, but 

#### I had options, but didn't take them

So why didn't I use [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) or [Secret Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?tabs=visual-studio?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)

For Azure Key Vault, I felt there was some overhead (such as learning it) that I didn't want to pay. It also is a very cheap service, but I wanted FREE. Regarding Secret Manager, that information is always stored in the user profile directory such as `%APPDATA%\microsoft\UserSecrets\<userSecretsId>\secrets.json` for Windows or `~/.microsoft/usersecrets/<userSecretsId>/secrets.json` for Mac/Linux. This means if other folks want to get your key store, they can target those directories b/c the JSON file is unencrypted. Not that my version is encrypted, it just isn't stored in the user profile directory. 

#### How I Prevent secrets from getting pushed to GitHub with .NET Core

Part 1:  

* I create a new .NET Core App in Visual Studio. (For example: A console app)
* I add a file called `appSecrets.json` and define a couple of secrets that I don't want getting out. Such as my Bit.ly API key and Azure Table Storage Connection String.

```asciidoc
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "BitlyAPI": "A_BITLY_API_KEY",
    "StorageAccountAPI": "MY_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY"
  }
}
```

Part 2:

* Set the `appSecrets.json` file to **Copy if newer** inside of Visual Studio.

Part 3:

* I add the following **NuGet** packages that allows us to easily read a local JSON file (such as our `appSecrets.json`) and extract key pieces of information:

* Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
* Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.FileExtensions
* Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json

Part 4:

* I add the following code inside the **Main** method. 
* This uses ConfigurationBuilder and searches for the file.

```csharp
var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
    .AddJsonFile("appSecrets.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true);
IConfigurationRoot configuration = builder.Build();
```

You can now access the value of the string with the following :

```csharp
configuration.GetConnectionString("StorageAccountAPI")
```

Part 5: **VERY IMPORTANT**

* Set your `/.gitignore` to ignore the `appSecrets.json` that we added.

```markdown
#### Ignore Visual Studio temporary files, build results, and
#### files generated by popular Visual Studio add-ons.

appSecrets.json
```

You can verify this file is ignored by looking for the **red circle** if using Visual Studio.
