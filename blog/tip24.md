### Add logic to your Testing in Production sites with PowerShell

#### Intro

We've recently created a [web app](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip19.html) and uploaded it to Azure App Service. We also took a look at [multiple ways](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip20.html) to examine those files through the Azure portal interface and how we'd add [extensions](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip21.html) and [deployment slots](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip22.html) for our web app. We also took a look at a feature called [Testing in Production](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip23.html) which allows us to distribute traffic between our production and other slots. In this post, we'll look at adding additional logic by using PowerShell to automatically distribute the load between your Production and deployment slot sites with the Testing in Production feature.   

#### Install the PowerShell Azure CLI first

**Hold up!** You'll want to take a look at the [deployment slots](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip22.html) and the [Testing in Production](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip23.html) post to have context on what we're going to do here.


Go to the [Azure CLI Projects page](https://azure.github.io/projects/clis/) and select select the WebPI Installer  or use the PowerShell gallery to bring together the power of Windows PowerShell and Azure.

Once it has been setup, type `az` from your PowerShell Window to see the shiny new way to interact with Azure.

#### PowerShell + Azure App Service + Your Web App = Win

Keep in mine that we [left off](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip23.html) with  two versions of our site. One that is `production` and `staging`. They are identical except for the staging site has a large font that says `jsQuizEngine version 2`. We just **distributed** traffic manually between the two sites by going into the Azure Portal and changing this value from the Testing in Production blade.

But what if we would like to generate rules to do this automatically where someone doesn't have to be inside the Portal manually changing this number?

That is where PowerShell and the Azure CLI comes to the rescue. The CLI is great for automation of tasks such as this one. Begin by opening PowerShell and logging in with `Add-AzureAccount`. It will ask to authenticate you.  After authenticated, then set the proper subscription by using `Select-AzureSubscription -Default -SubscriptionName "whatsubscriptionnameyouwanttouse"`. Now run the following script editing only the `siteName` parameter to match whatever you called your app.

```powershell
$siteName = "MyQuizApplication"
$rulesList = New-Object -TypeName System.Collections.Generic.List[Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.Utilities.Websites.Services.WebEntities.RampUpRule]
$rule = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.Utilities.Websites.Services.WebEntities.RampUpRule
$rule.Name = "stage"
$rule.ActionHostName = "$siteName-staging.azurewebsites.net"
$rule.ReroutePercentage = 90
$rulesList.Add($rule)
Set-AzureWebsite -RoutingRules $rulesList -Name $siteName -Slot production
```

If you open the Azure Portal and navigate to your site page and then `Testing in Production` then you'll see the percentage is automatically updated to 90% after the command runs.

**What did the script do again?** This script added a rule for our staging environment that set the `staging` route to a hard coded value of `90%`. 


If you wanted to scale this number up, for instance, start at 5% for 60 minutes and then increase the value by 5% until the traffic reaches 50% for that slot. You could do so with this script. 

```powershell
$siteName = "MyQuizApplication"
$rule1 = New-Object Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.Utilities.Websites.Services.WebEntities.RampUpRule
$rule1.ActionHostName = "$siteName-staging.azurewebsites.net"
$rule1.ReroutePercentage = 5;
$rule1.Name = "stage"
 
$rule1.ChangeIntervalInMinutes = 60;
$rule1.ChangeStep = 5;
$rule1.MinReroutePercentage = 5;
$rule1.MaxReroutePercentage = 50;
$rule1.ChangeDecisionCallbackUrl = $null
 
Set-AzureWebsite $siteName -Slot Production -RoutingRules $rule1
```

Notice that we only changed 5 lines here to get that functionality.
