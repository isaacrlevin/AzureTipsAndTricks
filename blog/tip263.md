### 5 Visual Studio Code extensions to remain productive while working remote

#### Intro - Enabling developers to work remotely

Working remotely has never been so approachable as it is today with tools and services enabling developers to collaborate, code, and ship from anywhere and any device. Recently I had a great opportunity to invite to my [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mbcrump?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) channel and stream on remote development with [Jonathan Carter](https://twitter.com/LostInTangent?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), a principal group program manager at Microsoft. Jonathan and his team are building one of the best developer productivity tools and services. Some of them we covered in our video. Enjoy these snippets of my stream with Jonathan on five essential Visual Studio Code extensions and tools for remote work.
