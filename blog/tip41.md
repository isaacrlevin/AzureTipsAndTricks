### Quickly Roll Back to a Previous Version of an Azure Logic App

This one seems to come up a lot, so I'll add it here. If you have created an Azure Logic App and would like to go back to a previous version, then you can do so very easily. Go ahead and open your logic app and look under **Development Tools** then **Versions** and select a previous version.

Once you select a previous version, you'll see **History**.

From here you can hit the **Promote** button and **Save** to use this version in production.
