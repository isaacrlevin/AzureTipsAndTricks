### Mount a drive and upload files to Cloud Shell

#### Overview

When working with [Azure Cloud Shell](http://shell.azure.com), you sometimes need the ability to upload files to work with later. I'm going to call out the two methods that I use to accomplish this task all the time. 

#### Mount a drive and upload via the Azure Portal

In method one, we'll update the file share that's associated with Cloud Shell by using the `clouddrive mount` command. Note: that you may already have a cloud drive that is created upon initial start of cloud shell. Go ahead and spin up Azure Cloud Shell and type `clouddrive -h` to see the commands to mount and unmount a drive. 

```shell
michael@Azure:~$ clouddrive -h

Group
  clouddrive                  :Manage storage settings for Azure Cloud Shell.

Commands
  mount                       :Mount a file share to Cloud Shell.
  unmount                     :Unmount a file share from Cloud Shell.
  ```

To mount a drive, we'll type `clouddrive mount -h` to see a help screen that is looking for the following parameters:

```shell
Arguments
  -s | --subscription id          [Required]:Subscription ID or name.
  -g | --resource-group group     [Required]:Resource group name.
  -n | --storage-account name     [Required]:Storage account name.
  -f | --file-share name          [Required]:File share name.
  -d | --disk-size size                     :Disk size in GB. (default 5)
  -F | --force                              :Skip warning prompts.
  -? | -h | --help                          :Shows this usage text.
  ```

We'll now simply call `clouddrive mount -s subscription-id -g your-resource-group-name -n storage-account -f storage-file-name` to create our drive. Once it has completed, we'll navigate to the resource and hit the **Upload** button and upload a file. Again, you could have navigated to your existing resource group instead of creating a new one - but I want you to learn how to do this manually.

Now type `cd clouddrive` and `ls -l` and you should see the file you just uploaded:

```shell
michael@Azure:~/clouddrive$ ls -l
total 53
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 53385 May 29 23:55 cloudshellnew1.png
michael@Azure:~/clouddrive$
```

#### Upload via Cloud Shell button

The second method involves pressing the **Upload** button built right into Azure Cloud Shell.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/cloudshellnew2.png')">

After you press this button and provide the file, you'll see that it is uploading it into your `/HOME/username` folder

<img :src="$withBase('/files/cloudshellnew3.png')">

Now you can simply type `cp filename cloudrive` to copy the file and have access to the file via cloud drive.
