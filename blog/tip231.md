### Top three things for Azure developers to watch at Microsoft Ignite 2019

[Microsoft Ignite](http://microsoft.com/ignite?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) is completely sold out but even if you didn't get a ticket, you can still participate from the comfort of your couch or heck, anywhere in the world if you've got a device that has internet connection. And who DOESN'T.

Save this date - **Tuesday, November 5th** and this URL - [https://microsoft.com/ignite](https://microsoft.com/ignite?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev).

Because on Tuesday, November 5th, will take over the airwaves with a full day of sessions and demos that is perfect to occupy your second, third or fourth monitor. Scott Hanselman, self-proclaimed World's Okayest Programmer, will kick off the day by weaving tacos and lizards into a demo-packed developer keynote that you won't want to miss! After the keynote, stay tuned to Microsoft Ignite Live for behind-the-scenes interviews and live coding how-to's.

**[App development for everyone with Hanselman and friends](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/81591?source=sessions?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)**

In this session Scott Hanselman and friends welcome every developer to a fun demo-packed session where we explore how you can grow your skills and build any kind of application with your favorite tools and languages, collaborate with the largest developer community on the planet, and release your apps in an open and innovative end-to-end cloud platform.
