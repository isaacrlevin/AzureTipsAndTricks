### Creating an IoT Hub for the IoT Button

#### The Series So Far

At Build 2018, we first saw the [IoT Button](http://aka.ms/button?WT.mc_id=akams-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). I started [exploring the device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdGHWwRBf_c?WT.mc_id=youtube-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) with the very first unboxing and decided to create a mini-series to walk you how to use the device from start to finish. The series (so far) is located below

I recently recorded a fun video with my daughter unboxing the new [IoT Button](http://aka.ms/button?WT.mc_id=akams-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) that was handed out at Build 2018.

#### We need an IoT Hub, Captain!

Before we can start enjoying the IoT Button, we first need to setup an IoT Hub. 

Go inside of the Azure Portal and search for **IoT Hub** and begin to create one. Fill out the following information, but keep notepad open and save the **IoT Hub Name**.

Make sure that you select the **Free Tier** and you can leave the rest at defaults. If you already have an IoT Hub with a free tier, then you'll need to either use that one or delete it to create another free tier.

Once it creates, save your Hostname as you'll use that later.

You'll want to click on **Shared Access Policies** and then **iothubowner** and copy and paste the **Conneection String - Primary** for later use.

Now download [Device Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/releases?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) for Windows or you can use the iothub-explorer tool for Mac. Now paste in your IoT Hub Connection string and press **Update**. You should see SAS populate.

Switch over to the **Management** tab and click **Create** and give it a name and select **Auto-Generate Keys**, and then **Create**.

The keys are now created, copy them someplace safe.

Right click on the newly created device and select **Copy connection string for selected device**. Now that you have they keys, we'll need to configure the device tomorrow.
