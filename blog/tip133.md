### Use the Azure Portal for Durable Functions Development

Durable Functions addresses the task of managing state for an application. They are intended to address a variety of patterns and scenarios that would quickly get complicated using triggers, timers, etc. especially when orchestrating a range of activities with a set of tasks that need to happen each time a particular event occurs.

Here is one example: I have one task, that causes another task to occur, and so on with some conditional statements and other business logic to fork the workflow but Iâ€™m trying to go from point a to point b. An example of this is called **Function chaining**. This refers to the pattern of executing a sequence of functions in a particular order.

Head over to our [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-sequence?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) for more info or follow along with this tutorial and it might make sense. 

#### Getting Started

Log into the Azure Portal and create a new Azure Function project like the following:

<img :src="$withBase('/files/azdfunc1.png')">

Configure the function app to use the 2.0 runtime version in the **Function app** settings tab.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/azdfunc2.png')">

Create a new custom function. 

<img :src="$withBase('/files/azdfunc3.png')">

Search for the **Durable Functions Http Starter - C#** template.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/azdfunc4.png')">

Install the extention when prompted.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/azdfunc5.png')">

Give the orchestration client function a name **HttpStart** that is created by selecting Durable Functions Http Starter - C# template.

<img :src="$withBase('/files/azdfunc6.png')">

Once this is complete, then copy the URL as we'll use it later on.

Create a new orchestration function named **HelloSequence** and select **Durable Functions Orchestrator** template.

Create another function named **Hello** and use the **Durable Functions Activity** template.

Install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps), and create a POST request and use the following URL (after suppling the new Azure Function Name) : `https://yourfunctionname.azurewebsites.net/api/orchestrators/HelloSequence`

You should see the following: 

<img :src="$withBase('/files/azdfunc7.png')">

Click on one of the **statusQueryGetUri** URLs and you see the status of the Durable Function : 

<img :src="$withBase('/files/azdfunc8.png')">
