### Deployment Slots for Web Apps using the Azure CLI

#### What are Deployment Slots?

Deployment Slots are a feature of Azure App Service. They actually are live apps with their own hostnames. You can create different slots for your application (for e.g. Dev, Test or Stage). The Production slot is the slot where your live app resides. With deploymet slots, you can validate app changes in staging before swapping it with your production slot. You can read more about deployment slots [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-staged-publishing "Set up staging environments in Azure App Service").

#### Pre-Requisites

* Microsoft Azure Subscription (Sign up for [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)/ "Create your Azure free account today"))
* Microsoft Azure CLI (Install from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest "Install Azure CLI 2.0"))

#### Log in to Azure

Before executing any Azure CLI commands, you will need to login first.
