### Quickly display a list of all Azure Web Apps URL from Azure Cloud Shell

Often I need to quickly list out the URLs for all Azure App Services in a given resource. In the past, when it just a small number then I'd do it manually, but it has recently grown to a point where I needed to find a better way. 

Enter PowerShell and Azure Cloud Shell. 

Wherever you are logged in with Azure Cloud Shell and are using PowerShell, then you can quickly run this command:

`Get-AzureRmWebApp | foreach-object {$_} | select-object SiteName, DefaultHostName, ResourceGroup`
