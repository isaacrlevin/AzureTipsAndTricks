### How to restore accidental deletion of your Azure Storage Blobs

#### Soft delete for Azure Storage Blobs
 
Azure Storage offers soft delete for blob objects so that you can more easily recover your data when it is erroneously modified or deleted by an application or other storage account user. When turned on, soft delete enables you to save and recover your data where blobs or blob snapshots are deleted. This protection extends to blob data that is erased as the result of an overwrite.

#### Enable Soft delete feature in Azure Storage

1. Create a Storage Container inside the Storage account.

2. Go to Soft delete under Blob service section

3. Enable the "Soft delete" option. By default it's disabled and the retention policy is 7 days. You can increase the retention period up to 365 days.
