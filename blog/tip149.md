### Use PowerShell to quickly see if your Deployment Slot Swapped Successfully

A common scenario after sending a swap action to Azure App Service is to check its progress. While you can easily use the Azure Portal, another alternative that I often use is PowerShell.

You'll quickly learn that `Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/slotsswap/action` contains the information "Succeeded" that you are looking for at the 50th character if you start digging around in the PowerShell and Azure docs.

We can wrap this up in a bow with the following line:

```powershell
$a = Get-AzLog -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> | Where-Object { $_.operationname.value -contains "Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/slotsswap/action" -and $_.Status.Value -eq 'Succeeded'} 
$a | select { $_.eventtimestamp,$_.operationname.value,$_.status.value,$_.resourceid.substring(50) }
```

Now if you paste this in PowerShell, you should get the following:

As always, I hoped this help someone out there!
