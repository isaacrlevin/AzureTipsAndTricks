### Easily Upload and download Azure dashboards

Azure has recently added the ability for you to download or upload an existing Azure dashboard with just a couple of clicks. Previously, you had to use a separate tool like **Azure Resource Explorer** to get this data. Now, youâ€™ll see a new **Download** and **Upload** option on your Azure Dashboard as shown below:

Once you download the file it will be in a JSON format. Below is a short snippet that list my **Linux VM** that is on my portal page. 

```json
"1": {
"position": {
	"x": 4,
	"y": 0,
	"colSpan": 4,
	"rowSpan": 6
},
"metadata": {
	"inputs": [
	{
		"name": "queryInputs",
		"value": {
		"metrics": [
			{
			"resourceId": "/subscriptions/d1ecc7ac-c1d8-40dc-97d6-2507597e7404/resourcegroups/crumplinux-rg/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/crumplinux",
			"name": "Disk Read Bytes"
			},
...
```

Note the **colSpan** and **rowSpan** values here. 
 

You could edit this to change the **colSpan** and **rowSpan** to be a smaller tile by changing them to :

```json
 "colSpan": 2,
 "rowSpan": 2
```

Now save the file and upload it and you have your new tile:
