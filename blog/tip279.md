### Serverless operations with Azure DevOps

#### Build and deploy Azure Functions with Azure DevOps
[Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) are great for running tasks on demand, like processing queue messages or resizing images. They can run serverless, which means that you can run them without having to configure and maintain infrastructure. And with [Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), Microsofts' Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) solution, you can easily compile your Azure Functions and deploy to the Azure.

In this post, we'll take a look at how we can use Azure DevOps Pipelines to easily build and deploy an Azure Function to the cloud.

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* [An Azure DevOps project](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev )
* An [Azure Function based on .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) that is deployed and running in your Azure subscription
* The code for the Azure Function committed to a source control provider, like [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/repos?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) or [GitHub](https://github.com/?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)

#### Creating a build and release pipeline in minutes with Azure DevOps Pipelines
We'll start by creating a build pipeline in Azure DevOps Pipelines. This will compile the code for the Azure Function and make it into a package that can be deployed.

1. Go to the **Azure DevOps portal** ([https://dev.azure.com/](https://dev.azure.com?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)) and select your project
2. In the menu on the left, select **Pipelines**
3. Now select **Create Pipeline** to start creating one
4. The first step asks you where your code is. Before we give that information, click on the link below that says "Use the classic editor" to switch to the visual designer. This is easy to start with and from there you can still go back into the [YAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) configuration if you want
4. Now tell it where your source code is. This can be in [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/repos?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), [GitHub](https://github.com/?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) or somewhere else. Select the right code branch and select **Continue**
5. Next, you can select a build template to start from. There are many templates that come out of the box and you can also create a build pipeline from scratch. Scroll down to the template called **Azure Functions for .NET** and select **Apply**

(Select a build template in the Azure DevOps portal)

7. You'll now see the build pipeline. It has steps to compile the code, package the resulting files and publish them to a drop location, so that they can be used by another process, like a release pipeline. This all works out of the box and you can configure it as you like and add steps to the pipeline. Select **Save and queue** and **Save and run** after that to save the pipeline and start the build process.

Now that you have a working Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline that builds your Azure Function code, we will create a release pipeline that takes the result from the build and deploys that to Azure.

1. In the Azure DevOps portal, select **Releases** in the left menu
2. Click **New pipeline** to create your first release pipeline
3. The first thing that you'll see is the **Select a template blade**. Here, you can select a template to create a release process for one of the stages in your pipeline. Find the template called **Deploy a function app to Azure Functions** and select **Apply**
4. Next, you'll be asked to provide a **name** for the stage that you've just selected a template for. You can create multiple stages, like Dev, Test, Acceptance and production and deploy your application through all of them. You can even configure when a certain stage should start deploying and you can indicate that somebody needs to approve the deployment to certain stages. Fill in something like **"Production"**.
5. Now click on the stage to drill down into it and configure its steps

6. We only have one step in the process and that is **Deploy Azure Function App**. Select the step
7. Select the **Azure Subscription** to use for the deployment. If this is the first time that you use this subscription with Azure DevOps, you need to select **Authorize** to grant Azure DevOps permissions to use the subscription
8. Next, select **Function App on Windows** for **App Type**
9. For **App Service name**, select the App Service that you want to deploy your Function to
10. Click **Save**
11. Go back to the stages by selecting **Releases** in the breadcrumb menu and **Edit** after that

(Release pipeline in the Azure DevOps portal)

12. In the overview, click on the **Add an artifact tile**, and select the results of the build process
13. Click on the lightning icon of the artifact to configure continuous deployment. This automatically starts a release when a build successfully finishes
14. Now select **Create release** in the right-hand corner and select **Create** after that, to start deploying the Function to Azure
15. You should see a message that says that your release has been created. Click on the **link to the release** to see it running

After a while, the release will be finished and your Function is deployed to the Azure Function in Azure.

#### Conclusion
You've just used [Azure DevOps pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to create a complete Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) solution to deploy an [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to Azure. This was incredibly easy and took just a couple of minutes to complete. You can see how powerful Azure DevOps pipelines is as you can easily point the pipeline to other source code, add more tasks to the pipelines or select other templates, and use [YAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to create more advanced pipelines. Go and check it out!
