### Create Thumbnail Images with Azure Functions and Azure Storage 

In this mini-series, we're going to create an Azure Function that detects when a new image is added to Azure Storage and automatically creates a thumbnail image for us.

#### Part 1 (Setup) Azure Portal
 
Go ahead and open the **Azure Portal** and click **Create a Resource** and select **Azure Storage**. Weâ€™ll keep it simple as shown below to get started.

Once complete, go into the resource and look under **Services**.

Go ahead and click on **Blobs** and create a **Container** and give it the name **originals** and then create another one called **thumbs**.

**Remember this!** Think of a container in this sense as a folder. https://myblob/**container**/image1.jpg

We're going to need our Access Key shortly, so look under **Settings**, then **Access Keys** and copy the **connection string** to your clipboard.

**What is an Access Key?** This string will allow us to connect to the Storage Account.

#### Part 2 (Setup) Visual Studio

Create a C# Azure Function application by opening Visual Studio and selecting the template under the **Cloud** node as shown below:

Under Storage, change the default emulator to the **Azure Storage Account** that we created earlier:

We'll begin by using the **Timer Trigger** and **Azure Function v1** leaving everything as the defaults.

Once the project spins up, we'll use NuGet to pull in references to :

* ImageResizer `A helper class for Image Resizing`

Looking good so far and a good stopping point for today. Come back soon for the next post in the series where we'll begin putting this all together.
