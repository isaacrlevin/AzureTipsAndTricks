### Top 10 Azure resources that you can use today

#### Making sense of Azure

Azure is a big place and it is constantly evolving. This is great, because it means that you'll be able to use a service or feature that suits your specific scenario. But it can also be difficult to keep up with the huge world of Azure, to make sure that you know what you should use for your scenario. 

In this post, we'll highlight the top 10 Azure resources that can help you to stay up-to-date with Azure.
