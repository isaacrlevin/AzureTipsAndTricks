### Open an existing Azure Function in Visual Studio

I recently wanted to modify an existing Azure Function in Visual Studio 2017 and noticed this is very straightforward. Simply log into the portal and select your Azure Function, go to **Overview** and then click on **Download app content** as shown below:

You'll want to select the **Content and Visual Studio Project** as well as **Include app settings in the download**

**What is app settings?** This will include a `local.settings.json file which contains your application settings. 


Here is the content of my downloaded zip file. 

**What about third party .dlls?** Yep, they are included.

If you open Visual Studio, you can select the folder and begin working:

From here, I'd probably setup continuous deployment through pushing the code to GitHub and using the **Deployment options** found inside **Platform features** in the Azure portal.

**What about C# projects?** You will get a .csproj file in the output folder along with C# scripts (csx files).
