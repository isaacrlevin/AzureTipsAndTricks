### Pushing a Container Image to a Docker Repo

#### Containers for the rest of us

For some reason, I find containers are confusing and my goal with my [Azure Tips and Tricks](https://michaelcrump.net/azure-tips-and-tricks-complete-list/) is to try to make things easier. In this mini-series, I'll walk you through [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and how I use it with Azure. Below is a list of post that you can expect for this week.

#### Pushing a Container Image to a Docker Repo

Let's continue where we [left off](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip47.html) in our last post, in which we created a new image that we can distribute that contains our new app. In this post, we'll go ahead and push the image to a Docker repo to prep it for later. 

Make sure you have a [Docker account](http://www.docker.com) (It's free) and type `docker login` at the terminal or command prompt to ensure we are authenticated. 

```
Michaels-MacBook-Pro:~ mbcrump$ docker login
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username (mbcrump): mbcrump
Password: 
Login Succeeded
```

Now in order to push to a new repo, you'll need to tag the existing image. You can do so by typing `docker tag mbcrump:mynewapp mbcrump/firstimage`. Where `mbcrump:mynewapp` is the existing image that contains our new app and `mbcrump/firstimage` will be our repo name. Play close attention to the `mbcrump/firstimage` part as `mbcrump` is your Docker username.

Once that is complete, then use `docker push mbcrump/firstimage` to move it to a repository. 

```
Michaels-MacBook-Pro:~ mbcrump$ docker push mbcrump/firstimage
The push refers to a repository [docker.io/mbcrump/firstimage]

Michaels-MacBook-Pro:~ mbcrump$ 
```

Great! Now you can log into your account on [store.docker.com](http://store.docker.com) and if you click on repos, then you'll see it. 
<img :src="$withBase('/files/dockerazure10.png')">

You'll see that it provides instructions to push a new version of the image as well as the commands to do so from the CLI. 

#### To Recap what we've done so far

If you've been following the last four post, then we've went through the following steps: 

1. Installed and Setup Docker 
2. Verified installation through the CLI
3. Took a look at the Docker Store
4. Used an image from the Docker Store to build upon
5. Ran a Container and created a .NET Core app to it
6. Created a Shell Script to call the app through the new image
7. Added our app to a new container image
8. Called the app through the command line and executed our program
9. Packaged up the image container to send to a Docker repo
10. Pushed our image container to Docker through the CLI

I think we have a great foundation to keep building on this in the coming weeks and months. I hope you've learned a lot this week and I'll see you next week. 

**Bonus:** You can also go to [store.docker.com](http://store.docker.com) and create a repository. You'll also notice that they provide the CLI commands as well.
