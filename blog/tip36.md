### Quickly Renew or Revoke Azure Functions Keys

There are times when you've created a new Azure Function HTTP Trigger where your Function Key needs to be changed. For example, here is my Function URL: 

<img :src="$withBase('/files/funckey1.png')">

`https://mynewtestapp100.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTriggerCSharp1?code=FJmHHtDmvqwp4wn0zXCS9J70NbakcmNDYCwM6trPOCTK3TdiCVg8pA==`

If you go to that page, you'll see the Trigger was activated as you passed the key: 

```
This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.
<string xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/')">
Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body
</string>
```

If something happens and someone gets the key, then you should go back to your Function and click **Manage**, then press **Revoke**. Now you can quickly gneerate a new key with the **Add new function key**. You'll need to provide the name **default** and can leave the value empty. Now simply click **Save** and if you go back to  your Function and click on **Get Function URL**, then you'll notice the new key is in place.
