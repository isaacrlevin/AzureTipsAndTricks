### Working with Azure Logic App using Visual Studio 2017

A great tip that I remember learning from [Jeff Hollan](https://twitter.com/jeffhollan?lang=en?WT.mc_id=twitter-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) is that folks can work with Logic Apps with Visual Studio. I'm going to use Visual Studio 2017 but previous version work as well. 

Fire up Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** -> **New Project** -> **Cloud** -> **Resource Group**

Give it a name and then you'll need to choose a template. Scroll down until you see **Logic App**.

Once everything spins up, you'll notice you have the following file structure in Visual Studio. 

<img :src="$withBase('/files/vs2017logicapp3.png')">

* Deploy-AzureResourceGroup.ps1 - Is a PowerShell deployment script for the Logic App
* LogicApp.json - This is where your main logic for your Logic App Lives
* LogicApp.parameters.json - The parameters file that you'll mostly want to leave alone

If you click on the **LogicApp.json** you'll see the code and a **JSON Outline** in Visual Studio and you could begin hand coding your app, but I'd rather use a designer. Go ahead and go to **Tools** and **Extensions** and search for **Logic Apps** and press **Download**.

A VSIX installer will appear after you close out of Visual Studio and just follow the steps to install it.

Now you can right click your **LogicApp.json** and have the ability to open it with the Designer!

You'll need an internet connection and it will prompt you to log in.

Bingo! Now you're cooking with Fire! You can work with the designer just like you did in the Azure Portal.
