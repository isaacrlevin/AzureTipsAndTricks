### Use .NET Core WebAPI and Docker Compose

How hard do you think it is to:

* [Create and Publish a .NET Core WebAPI project](tip54.html)
* [Add it to a Docker Container using Docker Compose and push it to a Docker Hub](tip55.html)
* [Use it in Azure with Web App for Containers](tip56.html)

In this mini-series, we'll build on each part starting with creating and publishing a .NET Core WebAPI project. Today, we'll use Docker Compose to create an image and push it to Docker Cloud and we'll wrap up by deploying it to Azure using [Web App for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). 

#### Use .NET Core WebAPI and Docker Compose

Now that we have [created and published a .NET Core WebAPI project](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip54.html), we'll resume by using Docker Compose to create an image. 

Think of this as three steps: 

1.) We need a Dockerfile for the entire to understand the image we are creating. 
2.) We need a docker-compose.yml file to pass to the Docker Compose Command
3.) We need to run the Docker Compose command. 

#### Step 1

Let's begin by creating a Dockerfile. 

**What is a DockerFile?**  It is simply a text file containing the instructions needed to create a new container image. These instructions include identification of an existing image to be used as a base, commands to be run during the image creation process, and a command that will run when new instances of the container image are deployed. In other words, this file defines your appâ€™s environment so it can be reproduced anywhere.


Copy and paste the following and name it `Dockerfile` without an extension and place it in the same folder as your source code. 

```
FROM microsoft/aspnetcore:2.0
ARG source
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
COPY ${source:-obj/Docker/publish} .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "mbcwebapi.dll"]
```

Let's go over the main instructions: 

* The FROM instruction sets the container image that will be used during the new image creation process. In this case, we're using the base aspnetcore image from Microsoft.
* The EXPOSE instruction sets the port number.
* The COPY instruction provides where it is going to pull the final release from
* The ENTRYPOINT instruction provides the entry point into the application and in our case, we specify the release .dll. 

#### Step 2

We need a docker-compose.yml file to pass to the Docker Compose Command

**What is docker-compose.yml?**  This file defines the services that make up your app so they can be run together in an isolated environment.


```
version: '3'

services:
  mbcwebapi:
    image: mbcrump/mbcwebapi
    build:
      context: ./mbcwebapi
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

Let's go over the main instructions: 

When composing this Docker image, we will use the `mbcwebapi` project and build an image called `mbcrump/mbcwebapi`. We'll set the context to look in the `./mbcwebapi` folder and there it will find the `Dockerfile`. 

**Note:**  Please note that the image name `mbcrump/mbcwebapi` was based my Docker username and then the app name. If you don't have a Docker account, then you probably want to create one now. 


#### Step 3

We need to simply run `docker-compose up` and Docker Compose will start and run your entire app.

```

```

Excellent! We now have a ASP.NET WebAPI project living inside a Docker Container that we can push to Docker Hub. 

#### Push to Docker Cloud

Login to [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com) and create a repository. In my case, I used `mbcrump/mbcwebapi` just like in the docker-compose.yml example earlier. 

<img :src="$withBase('/files/dockerblog1.png')">

Head back to the terminal or command prompt and enter: 

`docker login` to authenticate your account. 

`docker push mbcrump/mbcwebapi:latest` to push your image to Docker Cloud. 

You can go back to Docker Cloud to verify it pushed successfully.
